      # originDistance is the distance (as a multiple of the distance from the centre of the shape to its edge in that dimension) that the shape is rotated about in spacetime. N.B I think values between 1 and -1 may cause weird behaviour. Since the rotation occus on one space-time axis of spacetime it is also the conversion rate between time and space. Can't be bothered to make it 100% match up to wAxisInc above, since my main concern was to make loops of useful size easier.

      # rotations is the number of times that the shape flips around the two remaining spatial axes which it is not already rotating into time. An integer number will always create a coherant "regular" 4d shape. If the shape has a symettry of the form that you could rotate it a fraction of 360 degrees and it would be self similar, then you should also be able to exclude the remaining spatial dimension and rotate by a non-integer multiple of that fraction in order to create a functional Klein shape (not tested)
